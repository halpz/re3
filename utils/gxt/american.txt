~w~8-Ball can supply you with what you're gonna need.

[TM2_A]
~w~TONI's off making people bleed or trying to.

[TM2_AA]
~w~He'll never be as tough as his Pop, but he left you a note on the table.

[TM2_B]
~w~The laundry has agreed to pay - you did real good kid!

[TM2_C]
~w~Go collect the cash and bring it back here. Watch out for the Triads.

[TM2_D]
~w~They may be shoving a firecracker up your ass, but don't take no crap.

[TM2_E]
~w~Nobody I mean nobody, messes with TONI CIPRIANI!

[TM2_1]
~g~Get the cash back to Toni's!!

[TM2_2]
~g~You iced them all!

[TM3_MA]
~w~I don't know where he is!

[TM3_MB]
~w~I swear that boy of mine don't know himself sometimes.

[TM3_MC]
~w~Now his father, he was different. Always on top, in charge, manful...

[TM3_A]
~w~Don Salvatore has called a meeting.

[TM3_B]
~w~I need you to collect the limo and his boy, Joey, from the garage.

[TM3_C]
~w~Then get Luigi from his club, come back here and pick me up,

[TM3_D]
~w~then we'll all drive over to the boss's place together.

[TM3_E]
~w~Those Triads, they don't know when to stop.

[TM3_F]
~w~They want a war. They got a war.

[TM3_G]
~w~Now get going.

[TM3_1]
~g~Pick up the Stretch from Joey's.

[TM3_2]
~g~Now go pick up Luigi.

[TM3_3]
~g~Now go pick up Toni.

[TM3_4]
~g~Drive the goodfellas to Salvatore's place.

[TM3_5]
~y~It's a triad ambush!!

[TM4_B]
~w~We're at WAR! The Triads have a fish factory as a front.

[TM4_C]
~w~Most of their business goes down at the fish market in Chinatown.

[TM4_D]
~w~That laundry still owes us protection.

[TM4_E]
~w~They reckon the Triads are protecting them now, so I say we exact a fitting punishment.

[TM4_F]
~w~Take these boys over and whack the Triad Warlords!

[TM4_G]
~w~Hell, if you get a chance, pop some of their soldiers too.

[TM4_GAT]
~g~You need a 'Triad fish van' to enter.

[TM5_B]
~w~OK, I've had enough of this shit.

[TM5_C]
~w~We're gonna finish the Triads in Liberty once and for all!

[TM5_D]
8-Ball's rigged a dustcart with a bomb.

[TM5_E]
~w~It's on a timer so if you mess up there'll be no evidence. Go and pick up the dustcart.

[TM5_F]
~w~Careful, 8-Ball says it's real sensitive and the slightest bump could set that thing off!

[TM5_G]
~w~Their fish factory will open its gates for a dustcart, so you can drive right in.

[TM5_H]
~w~Park up between the gas canisters and get the hell out of there!

[TM5_I]
~w~I want it to rain mackerel.

[TM5_J]
~w~We're talking real biblical here, nothing low budget.

~w~HEY MARIA! MOVE YOUR BUTT!

[FM1_D]
~w~Dumb broad does this every time.

[FM1_E]
~w~And here she is, the one and only Queen of Sheba!

[FM1_F]
~w~What were you doing up there?

[FM1_G]
~w~Whatever it was, I bet it cost me money.

[FM1_H]
~w~Well, you don't think I hang around for the conversation, do you?

[FM1_I]
~w~Get in that car and keep your big mouth shut.

[FM1_J]
~w~Take the limo but bring it back in one piece, y'hear me?

[FM1_K]
~w~And watch her, she can be trouble.

[FM1_L]
~w~Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm sure your new lap dog has everything covered,

[FM1_M]
~w~and isn't he big and strong?

[FM1_N]
~w~Hey Fido, Let's go visit Chico and get some party treats!

[FM1_P]
~g~That's Chico over there, pull up next to him.

[FM1_S]
~w~Here you go lady.

[FM1_TT]
~w~IT'S A POLICE RAID!

[FM1_1]
~g~Get back into the Stretch!

[FM1_2]
~g~Get into the Stretch!

[FM1_3]
~r~Leave Maria and Salvatore will have you whacked, go back and pick her up.

[FM1_4]
~g~You've dumped the Don's woman! Get back to the warehouse and wait for Maria!

[FM1_5]
~g~Get Maria safely back to Salvatore's!

[FM1_6]
~g~Chico won't be there forever, get Maria to the waterfront!

[FM1_7]
~r~Maria's dead! Salvatore won't be too pleased...

[FM1_8]
~r~You wasted Maria's supplier!

[FM2_J]
Leave us alone for a minute.

[FM2_A]
The Colombian Cartel is making SPANK somewhere in Liberty.

[FM2_K]
but we don't know where, and they seem to know everything we're doin' before we do.

[FM2_L]
There is a guy named Curly Bob works the bar at Luigi's.

[FM2_M]
He's been throwing more money around than he's earning.

[FM2_N]
He usually gets a taxi home after work. So follow him.

[FM2_O]
And if he's rattin' us out... kill him.

[FM2_F]
Here comes our little friend. Mr big mouth himself.

[FM2_G]
Were you followed? You know what goes on here is our little secret.

[FM2_H]
No..no, I wasn't followed. You got my stuff?

[FM2_I]
Here's your SPANK, squealer, now talk.

[FM2_P]
OK, so the Leone's are fighting wars on two fronts.

[FM2_Q]
They're in a turf war with the Triads with no sign of either side giving up.

[FM2_R]
Meanwhile Joey Leone has stirred up some bad blood with the Forellis.

[FM2_S]
Every day they're losing men and influence in the city.

[FM2_T]
Salvatore is becoming dangerous and paranoid. He suspects everybody and everything.

[FM2_U]
With loyalty like yours, what has he possibly got to worry about.

[FM2_1]
~g~There's Curly Bob!

[FM2_2]
~g~Curly's left the club, tail him!

[FM2_5]
~g~Take him to Portland Harbor.

[FM2_6]
~r~Curly won't get into a smashed-up taxi!

[FM2_7]
~r~Curly's spooked! The meeting's off!

[FM2_8]
~g~Whack Curly Bob!

[FM2_9]
~r~Curly Bob's dead!

[FM2_10]
~r~Curly got away!

[FM2_11]
~g~Park out the front of Luigi's Club, Curly Bob will be leaving shortly.

[FM2_12]
~r~He gave you the slip!

[FM3_A]
~w~We should take these Colombian bastards out,

[FM3_B]
~w~but while we're at war with the Triads we ain't strong enough.

[FM3_C]
~w~The Cartel has got bottomless funds from pushing that SPANK crap.

[FM3_D]
~w~If we make an open attack on them, they'll wipe the floor with us.

[FM3_E]
~w~They must be making SPANK on that big boat that Curly lead you to.

[FM3_F]
~w~So we gotta use our heads, or rather one head. Your head.

[FM3_G]
~w~I'm asking you to destroy that SPANK factory as a personal favor to me, Salvatore Leone.

[FM3_H]
~w~If you do this for me, you will be a made man, anything you want.

[FM3_I]
~w~Go and see 8-Ball, you'll need his expertise to blow-up that boat.

[FM3_8A]
~w~Yo my man! Salvatore phoned ahead,

[FM3_8B]
~w~but a job like this is gonna need a lot of fireworks.

[FM3_8D]
~w~but you know with me you get a lot of bang for your buck.

[FM3_8E]
~w~Okay, let's do this thing!

[FM3_8F]
~w~I can set this baby to detonate, but I still can't use a piece with these hands.

[FM3_8G]
~w~Here, this rifle should help you pop some heads!

[FM3_4]
~g~Stop the vehicle and let 8-Ball out!

[FM3_7]
~r~8-Ball's been iced!

[FM3_8]
~r~The guards have been alerted!

[FM4_A]
~w~It's my favorite cleaner.

[FM4_B]
~w~I'm proud of you my boy, you kicked the shit out of those grease balls.

[FM4_C]
~w~I've got just one little job for you before we can all celebrate.

[FM4_D]
~w~There's a car around the block from Luigi's club.

[FM4_E]
~w~The inside is covered in brains.

[FM4_F]
~w~We had to help some guy make up his mind and it proved a little messy.

[FM4_H]
~w~Take it to the crusher before the cops find it.

I am Yakuza and I know you worked for Salvatore Leone's family.

[AM1_D]
I can give you work with our organization,

But first you must prove to me that your ties with the Mafia are truly broken.

[AM1_G]
Make sure he doesn't reach his club alive.

[AM1_H]
Meanwhile Maria and I will catch up on old times.

[AM1_I]
Oh..Asuka, you've got a massager.

[AM1_J]
That's not a massager.

[AM1_1]
~g~Salvatore is now leaving Luigi's!

[AM1_2]
~r~You have been spotted!

[AM1_3]
~r~You've missed Salvatore!

[AM1_4]
~r~Nice going, you scared off the target! Call yourself a hitman?

[AM1_5]
~g~Get to the Red Light District and wait for Salvatore to leave the club.

[AM1_7]
~r~Salvatore's home, safe and sipping a cocktail. Ain't no one gonna call you the 'Jackal'!

~g~Salvatore will be leaving Luigi's at about ~1~:~1~

[AM2_4]
~g~They seen you coming like a dayglow elephant!

A reporter has been nosing around.

[AM3_B]
Maria and I have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur.

[AM4_A]
It's my handsome handyman!

[AM4_B]
Maria's all tied up at the moment but I'll tell her you called.

[AM4_C]
Who's that? Asuka? I know I've been a naughty girl but I really need to pee! OK?

[AM4_D]
It's time you met our man inside the LPD.

[AM4_E]
Here's his payment for the last little job he did for us.

[AM4_F]
He is understandably cautious.

[AM4_G]
Get to the pay phone in Torrington as quick as you can and await his instructions.

[AM5_A]
Maria and I have gone shopping.

[AM5_B]
Our source in the police has informed us that one of our drivers is a strangely animated undercover cop!

[AM5_C]
He's more or less useless out of his car, so we've tagged it with a tracer.

Make him bleed!

My sister speaks highly of you,

though I am yet to be convinced that a gaijin can offer anything but disappointment.

Perhaps you could help deal with a situation that has me at a disadvantage.

[KM1_F]
Of course failure has its own disgrace.

[KM1_C]
A Yakuza Kanbu is in custody awaiting transfer for trial.

[KM1_G]
He is a valued member of the family.

[KM1_H]
Break him out of custody and get him to the dojo at Bedford Point.

[KM1_D]
We thankyou for your selfless actions. If you ever need help the dojo will be honoured to provide two men who will stand at your side.

[KM1_1]
~g~Steal a cop car!

[KM1_2]
~g~Rig the car with a bomb!

[KM1_3]
~g~Now get him to the Yakuza dojo.

[KM1_5]
~g~Okay now go to the police station.

~r~You did not use a car bomb to destroy the wall

[KM1_10]
~r~The Yakuza Kanbu is dead -along with your honor!

[KM1_11]
~r~You brought the heat down on yourself!

[KM2_A]
It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of etiquette in this line of work.

[KM2_B]
To my eternal shame, a man once did me a favor and I have never had the opportunity to repay his kindness.

[KM2_C]
The man's weakness is motor cars and he has requested that we acquire him certain models for his collection.

[KM2_F]
My honor demands it.

[KM2_2]
~g~Car delivered.

[KM3_A]
When trouble looms, the fool turns his back, while the wise man faces it down.

[KM3_B]
The Colombian Cartel have ignored repeated requests to leave our interests in Liberty well alone.

[KM3_C]
Now they are negotiating terms with the Jamaicans in order to humiliate us further.

[KM3_D]
They are finalizing a deal across town.

[KM3_F]
Take one of my men, steal a Yardie car, and go and pay your respects to the Colombians.

~g~You need a Yardie car to get on with the job!

[KM3_9]
~r~One of the Colombians is dead, the deal's off.

[KM3_10]
~r~The contact is dead!

[KM4_A]
To be truly strong, it is important that you never show weakness.

[KM4_C]
Go and collect the money immediately, so we can enter it into the casino accounts.

[KM4_1]
I can't pay you and I wouldn't pay you if I could!

[KM4_9]
Some young gang just jacked out the place! They took everything!

[KM4_2]
You guys are useless.

[KM4_10]
What kind of Yakuza are YOU anyway...?

This ain't what I pay you goons for. If I wanted this kind of protection I'd have used the god damn police service

There's the money its all there!

~g~Briefcase collected!

[KM5_A]
YOU! How fitting you should choose this moment to show your worthless face!

[KM5_B]
It would appear your attempts to dissuade the Jamaicans

[KM5_B1]
from becoming bed fellows with the Cartel were wholly inadequate!

[KM5_C]
Yardie pushers line Liberty's streets selling packets of SPANK like they were selling hotdogs!

[KM5_D]
Those Cartel pigs are laughing at us, at me!

[KM5_E]
I will give you one last chance to prove my sister's faith in you to be well founded!

Hey, I'm bored when you gonna drill me?

[JM1_B]
In a moment sweet heart, I got a little business to take care of.

[JM1_C]
I got a little job for you pal.

[JM1_D]
The Forelli brothers have owed me money for too long

[JM1_E]
and they need to be taught some respect.

[JM1_F]
Lips Forelli is stuffing his fat face in St Marks Bistro,

[JM1_G]
so steal his car and take it to 8-Ball's bomb shop up in Harwood.

[JM1_H]
You know 8-Ball right?

[JM1_I]
Once he's fitted it with a bomb, go park the car where you found it.

[JM1_J]
Then sit back and watch the whole show.

[JM1_K]
But hurry up, he won't be eating forever.

[CAT2_A1]
Come on you dumb bitch!

[CAT2_A]
The real question is, did you turn up to rescue Maria or to get me back?

[CAT2_B]
Well I got news for you,

[CAT2_B2]
shooting you will be a pleasure but dating you was only business.

[CAT2_C]
You are muy peccinno amigo!

[CAT2_D]
Throw over the cash.

[CAT2_E]
You have been a busy boy!

[CAT2_E2]
But you haven't learned, I'm not to be trusted.

[CAT2_E3]
Kill the idiot.

[CAT2_J]
Get this thing airborne!!

[HM5_1]
Yo, Ice said was comin'. There rules. Bats only. No guns, no cars.

[HM5_5]
This is a battle for respect, you cool?

[HELP14]
To collect weapons walk through them. These cannot be collected while in a vehicle.

[CRUSH]
Park in the marked area and exit your vehicle. The vehicle will then be crushed.

[DIAB2_B]
A gang of no-goods has threatened to remove my starring member if I don't pay them a cut.

[DIAB2_C]
They threaten the wrong man, amigo.

[DIAB2_D]
They have a weakness for the icecream.

[DIAB2_E]
Pick up the bomb I've hidden in Harwood,

[DIAB2_F]
hijack the regular icecream van on its rounds.

[DIAB2_G]
and lure these fools to their doom with the jeengle-jeengle.

[DIAB2_H]
They hide in a warehouse on Atlantic Quay.

[DIAB3_A]
Some insolent Triads stole my beautiful car last night,

[DIAB3_B]
wrecked it and left it burning.

[DIAB3_C]
Some of my most precious donkey memorabilia was in the trunk -

[DIAB3_D]
real collectibles that are irreplaceable my friend.

[DIAB3_E]
I've hidden a throbbing weapon on the edge of Chinatown.

[DIAB3_F]
Take it and teach these Triad vandals to fear El Burro's well-endowed wrath.

[DIAB3_1]
KILL 25 TRIADS

[DIAB4_A]
A thieving opportunist has stolen a van of my latest publication hot off the press!

[DIAB4_B]
But that SPANKED-up idiot has left the rear doors open

[DIAB4_C]
and now my beautifully produced,

[DIAB4_D]
tastefully photographed adult literature is being dropped all over Liberty!

[DIAB4_E]
Take the van and follow that trail of Donkey Does Dallas volumes 1, 2 and 3

[DIAB4_F]
collecting it as you go.

[DIAB4_G]
When you've followed the trail to that thieving SPANK-head, waste him!

[DIAB4_H]
Then deliver my donkey derby to XXX Mags in the Red Light District.

[DIAB4_1]
~g~Take the van to the back of XXX Magazines.

[HM1_E]
I want you to show these punk ass bitches how a real drive-by works.

[HM1_H]
Take these nines off of here!!

[HM2_A]
Those Nines are pressing me.

[HM2_B]
These Bitches got armored cars and now they're running SPANK...

[HM2_C]
and slinging it to brothers with no fear.

[HM2_D]
There's a car parked up the way.

[HM2_E]
There's some stuff in there to put these sissys on blass...

[HM3_A]
Some effa has wired my wheels to blow.

[HM3_B]
If I lose those wheels, my rep on the street will be dead.

[HM3_C]
Pick up my car and take it over to the garage on St. Marks, a'right yo.

[HM3_D]
Let them diffuse that, let them take care of that bomb.

[HM3_E]
The clocks ticking and the wiring is messed up.

[HM3_F]
One pot hole too many and that thing could blow.

[HM3_G]
Now move it!

[HM4_A]
Yo, a Federal Reserve flight just smashed down at Francis International.

[HM4_B]
There's platinum all over the strip.

[HM4_C]
Get a car and snatch up as much as you can.

[HM4_F]
You can drop the bling off at one of my garages.

[HM4_G]
This platinum is mad heavy and it will slow your wheels down some.

[HM4_H]
So make regular drop off's at the garage.

[HM5_A]
Them Nines are down to a few scabby herds...

[HM5_B]
but they still wanna bring it.

[HM5_C]
They agreed to go toe to toe.

[HM5_D]
A gang of them against two of us, or rather...

[HM5_E]
two of yaw

[HM5_F]
I'd join you but...

[HM5_G]
I ain't due my parole hearing for another three months now,

[HM5_H]
y'know what I mean?

[HM5_I]
Go and meet my baby brother,

[HM5_J]
He'll show you where they are fighting a'right son.

[MEA1_B]
The name's Chonks, Marty Chonks.

[MEA1_C]
I run the Bitchin' Dog Food factory around the corner.

[MEA1_D]
I got money troubles, but hey, who doesn't right?

[MEA1_E]
I'm meeting my bank manager later.

[MEA1_F]
He's a crooked bastard that keeps bumping up the loan repayments so he can cut a slice.

[MEA1_G]
Take my car, pick him up and bring him back here.

[MEA1_H]
I've got a little surprise for that blood sucking leech!!

[MEA2_A]
I hired some thieves to break into my apartment...

[MEA2_C]
The thieving bastards are threatening to tell the insurance company,

[MEA2_D]
if I don't give them a cut.

[MEA2_E]
Can you believe it?

[MEA2_F]
I've left a car inside the factory gates.

[MEA2_G]
Use it to go and pick them up from their turf in the Red Light district.

[MEA2_H]
Then bring 'em back to the factory so I can make 'em see Marty's point of view.

[MEA3_A]
The business is going to go under unless I get hold of some serious cash soon.

[MEA3_B]
My wife has an insurance policy and all she's ever been to me is a hole in my pocket.

[MEA3_C]
I've left a car in the usual place.

[MEA3_D]
Go and pick up my wife from Classic Nails and bring her back to the factory.

[MEA4_A]
Damn, I'm in trouble!

[MEA4_B]
Turns out my wife was seeing some guy I owe money to.

[MEA4_C]
He's got real angry and he's looking for payback!

[MEA4_E]
he thinks I'm gonna pay him off...

[MEA4_F]
but my guess is...

[MEA4_G]
Liberty's dogs are gonna get yet another flavor this month!

Some Diablo scumbag has been pimping his skuzzy bitches in my backyard.

[FM2_B]
We got us a rat!

[KM2_E]
You must obtain the cars on this list and deliver them to a garage behind the car park in Newport.

~w~Get a good vantage point then I'll head in when you fire the first shot.

[LOVE1_B]
Experience has taught me that a man like you can be very loyal for the right price,

[LOVE1_C]
A valued resource, an old oriental gentleman I know,

[LOVE1_I]
has been kept hostage by some South Americans in Aspatria.

I've agreed to see him...

[AS1_D]
~w~Act as the bait, and get the death squads to follow you to Pike Creek

[AS1_E]
~w~where some of my men will be waiting for them.
